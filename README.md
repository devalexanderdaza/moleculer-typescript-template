## Init new project

```sh
npx degit jellydn/moleculer-typescript-template [PROJECT-NAME]
```

## Install

In the terminal, try the following commands:

-   `call greeter.hello` - Call the `greeter.hello` action.
-   `call greeter.welcome --name John` - Call the `greeter.welcome` action with the `name` parameter.

Add new service to your project with below command

```sh
yarn generate:service [service-name]
```

## Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```

## Deployment

This template comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

-   [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

-   Sign up and log in to Fly

    ```sh
    fly auth signup
    ```

-   Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

    ```sh
    fly create moleculer-typescript
    fly create moleculer-typescript-staging
    ```

-   Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new)

-   Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

Now that every is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.
